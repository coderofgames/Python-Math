    "The function $\\mathbf F$ can be constant, with the normal as a function of the surface at the point. For a cylinder revolved around the $x$ axis, there is no need to double integrate.

    "The pressure $p$ has been set to -1. Then to stationarize or to find the minimum resitive force arc from x = 0 to x = a we apply the Beltrami equation, since the functional does not depend explictly on $x$.\n",
