    "The flux integral over a surface $S$ sums the components of the Force $F$ in the direction of the normal vector accross the total area $A$ of the surface.\n",

    "$$ \\iint_S \\mathbf F\\cdot \\mathbf n dA $$\n",
    "   \n",
    "The function $\\mathbf F$ can be constant, with the normal as a function of the surface at the point. For a cylinder revolved around the $x$ axis, there is no need to double integrate. To evaluate the pressure on the surface, if the surface is moving in the positive x direction, we change reference frame to measure a constant pressure $p=F/A$ moving in the negative x direction.\n",

    "This integral sums the total force, as its pressure times area, with area being constrained to 2 dimensions. To minimize the resitive force, this integral needs to be re-expressed in a variational formulation. The normal vector to a line is easily computed as follows\n",

    "for straight lines, $y=m_1 x+c$ where the tangent (gradient) is $m_1 = y' = \\frac{dy}{dx}$ and the normal is given by, the normal is the inverse of the gradient (in 2D) $m_2 = -\\frac{1}{m_1}$.  and the integral becomes\n",

    "The pressure $p$ has been set to -1. Then to stationarize or to find the minimum pressure arc from x = 0 to x = a we apply the Beltrami equation, since the functional does not depend explictly on $x$.\n",
