    "### Interior (or Region) and Boundary\n",
    "   \n",
    "A set can be thought to consist of an interior and a boundary. The boundary is the border between the set and whatever else is in the space, points on the boundary are not considered to be part of the *interior* of the set.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Open Sets\n",
    "   \n",
    "If every point in the interior of a set $U$ in $E^n$ (n-dimensional euclidean space) can be enclosed in a spherical neighbourhood also contained in the interior of $U$ then $U$ is said to be an <b>Open Set </b>\n",
    "   \n",
    "> For the interval then each point in $E^1$ is enclosed in a 1-sphere\n",
    "> For the region in $E^2$ then each point is enclosed in a 2-sphere (or circle)\n",
    "etc\n",
    "\n",
    "   \n",
    "1) The union of a family of open sets is open.\n",
    "2) the intersection of a family of open sets is not neccessarily open.\n",
    "3) The definition of the open set does not include the boundary of the set.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Closed Sets\n",
    "   \n",
    "A set is called <b>closed</b> if it is not open. The complement of a closed set $S^c$ is open, and visa versa. It can also be deduced (from below) that a set is closed iff it contains its limit points.\n",
    "\n",
    "> If $V$ is an open Sphere $U$ together with its boundary $B$ then $V$ is a closed set.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Deleted Spherical Neighbourhoods\n",
    "    \n",
    "A deleted spherical neighbourhood of a point $P$ in $S$ is said to contain every $S(P)$ without $P$, - it contains the spherical neighbourhood of $P$ without $P$.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Limit points\n",
    "   \n",
    "A point $P$ is said to be a limit point of a set $S$ if every deleted spherical neighbourhood $S'(P)$ of $P$ contains at least one point of $S$.\n",
    "\n",
    "> The boundary of a circle contains limit points since a spherical neighbourhood surrounding the boundary contains points within the circle.\n",
    "\n",
    "###  Closure\n",
    "   \n",
    "The closure $\\hat S$ of a set $S$ is the set consisting of $S$ and its limit points.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Bounded Sets\n",
    "   \n",
    "A set is called bounded if it is contained in the neighbourhood of a point.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Connected Sets\n",
    "   \n",
    "A disconnected set is defined by the concept of a set consisting of more than one disconnected closed set, such that if you take intersecting open sets surrounding each then the resultant intersections of each of them do not intersect.\n",
    "$$  (A\\cap S) \\cap (B\\cap S) =  \\emptyset$$\n",
    "Where $A$ and $B$ are open sets.\n",
    "\n",
    "> A set is called <b>connected </b> if it is not disconnected.\n",
    "> A set is called <b>arc-wise</b> connected if any two points in $S$ can be connected by a continuous arc.\n",
    "> If a set $S$ in $E$ is arcwise connected then it is connected. (the converse is true for $E^1$ but there are connected sets in $E^3$ that are not arcwise connected - arcwise connectivity is not a defining feature of connected sets in general). \n",
    " \n",
    "### Domain\n",
    "\n",
    "An *open connected set* is called a <b>domain</b>. A domain is arcwise connected.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Compact Sets\n",
    "   \n",
    "An *open covering* of $S$ is a family of open sets whose union contains $S$. A *subcovering* is the subset of the open covering, and a finite covering is an open covering containing a finite number of subsets. Every set in $E$ has an open covering. \n",
    "\n",
    "A set in $E$ is compact if for every open covering of  $S$ there exists a finite subcovering.\n",
    "\n",
    "> A compact set is closed and bounded - if a set is closed and bounded it is compact by definition.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Continuous Mappings\n",
    "   \n",
    "If $E$ and $F$ are two spaces and $S$ is a subset of $E$, then if for each point $P$ in $S$ there is a point $f(P)$ in $F$, and if at a point $P_0$ in $E$ for *every* neighbourhood $N_F$ of $f(P_0)$ in $F$ there is a neighbourhood $N_E$ of $P_0$ in $E$ such that for every point $P$, the points in $f(P)$ are in $N_F$ for every $P$ in $N_E$.\n",
    "\n",
    "> The mapping $f$ is said to be continuous on $S$ if it is continuous at each point on $S$\n",
    "   \n",
    "> The image of a connected set under continuous mapping is connected.\n",
    "   \n",
    "> The image of a compact set under a continuous mapping is compact.\n",
    "   \n",
    "> A continuous real valued function on a compact set takes on its absolute maximum and minimum. \n",
    "   \n",
    "> A continuous mapping composed with a continuous mapping is a continuous mapping.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Homeomorphisms\n",
    "   \n",
    "If $f$ is a continuous mapping from $S$ in $E$ into $F$ then if $f$ has an inverse. If the inverse is continuous then $f$ is said to be bi-continuous. A bicontinuous mapping of $S$ into a set $T$ in $F$ is called a homeomorphism of $S$ into $T$. IF a homeomorphism exists between sets then the two sets are said to be topologically equivalent.  \n"

There are as many functions as basic vectors in $F$, i.e. $m$. The mapping of $V$ to $F$ is one to one, and onto if the images of the basis  vectors $\\mathbf f(\\mathbf e_i)$ are independant, i.e. the transformation of the basis vectors must be linearly independant. This is true if the determinant of the matrix of coefficients is not zero. In fact the rank of the coefficient matrix is the dimension of $F$ defined by $\\mathbf f$, so the rank should be predictably $m$ for a space of $m$ real valued homogeneous functions. This holds for mappings from $E^3$ into $E^3$, and for example if the rank of $\\mathbf f$ is 2 then the mapping is a plane. For mappings from $E^2$ into $E^3$ then the rank of $\\mathbf f$ determins the toppology in $E^3$. For example if the rank was 1 then $\\mathbf f$ would be a line in $E^3$. \n",
